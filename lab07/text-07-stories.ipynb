    "# Exercise: User Story generation\n",
    "\n",
    "User stories are brief, simple descriptions of a feature or requirement from the perspective of an end user. They are used in Agile software development to capture the user’s needs and goals in a way that prioritizes functionality and value. A typical user story follows the format:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"As a [type of user], I want [a specific goal] so that [reason or benefit].\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This format ensures the focus stays on delivering solutions that meet the user’s expectations. User stories guide development by defining clear, actionable tasks for teams while remaining flexible and open to adaptation as the project evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to create an agent architecture like the following one:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Specification (Domain Specification):**\n",
    "The process begins with the definition of a problem description, which outlines the domain or context of the system. This serves as the input to the LLM and sets the foundation for generating user stories. Our problem specification is provided as the input to the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Role(s) Extraction (\"Who\" Aspect):**\n",
    "A prompt is used to extract roles from the problem description.\n",
    "Roles represent the different types of users or stakeholders involved in the system This step answers \"who\" the user stories are about.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Function(s) Extraction (\"What\" Aspect):**\n",
    "Another prompt is used to extract functions associated with each role.\n",
    "Functions describe the specific actions or goals the roles aim to perform within the system. This step answers \"what\" the users want to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Purpose(s) Extraction (\"Why\" Aspect):**\n",
    "A subsequent prompt is used to determine the purposes behind the functions identified. Purposes explain the reasons or motivations behind the desired actions of the roles. This step answers \"why\" the users need the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **User Stories Generation:**\n",
    "Combining the roles (who), functions (what), and purposes (why), a final prompt generates complete user stories. These user stories take the standard Agile format: \"As a \\<who\\>, I want \\<what\\>, so that \\<why\\>.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Chain**:\n",
    "The process is iterative, as each step informs the next and ensures that the roles, functions, and purposes are fully aligned. The LLM is guided by a structured \"prompt chain,\" where prompts are carefully designed to extract specific information at each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "The final output consists of user stories that capture the needs and goals of the system's users in a concise, actionable format. These stories guide development teams in implementing the desired features and functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",

    "The diagram above shows the overall flow of the LLM architecture.\n",

    "requirements_text = \"The proposed platform is designed to enhance the hiking experience for various user groups, including visitors, local guides, platform managers, and hut workers. The platform provides a centralized repository of hiking routes, hut information, and parking facilities. It also enables interactive features such as real-time hike tracking, personalized recommendations, and group hike planning. By combining these capabilities, the platform seeks to foster safe, informed, and collaborative hiking experiences.\\\n",
    "The platform will be deployed as a cloud-based web and mobile application accessible to all stakeholders. The distribution strategy includes an app available on major mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, alongside a responsive web interface. It will require an internet connection for features like real-time tracking, notifications, and user authentication, though some offline capabilities, such as pre-downloaded hike information, will also be available.\\\n",
    "User authentication will be role-based, ensuring that only authorized users, such as verified hut workers and platform managers, can access sensitive or administrative features.\\\n",
    "Visitors are the primary users of the platform. They can browse a comprehensive list of hiking trails, filter them based on specific criteria such as difficulty, length, or starting point, and view detailed descriptions. To access advanced features like personalized recommendations, visitors can create user accounts by registering on the platform. Registered users can record their fitness parameters, enabling the system to suggest trails tailored to their capabilities.\\\n",
    "During a hike, visitors can record their progress by marking reference points and sharing their live location through a broadcasting URL. They can also initiate group activities by planning hikes, adding group members, and confirming group participation. The platform allows visitors to start, terminate, and track their hikes, with notifications for unfinished hikes or late group members to ensure safety and accountability.\\\n",
    "Local guides enrich the platform by contributing essential information. They can add detailed descriptions of hikes, parking facilities, and huts, ensuring hikers have accurate and comprehensive data. Local guides also link parking lots and huts to specific trails as starting or arrival points, enhancing the planning process.\\\n",
    "To aid in the visual representation and accessibility of information, local guides can upload pictures of huts and connect these locations directly to hikes. This integration simplifies route planning and helps visitors visualize their journey.\\\n",
    "Platform managers oversee the operational integrity and safety of the platform. They verify new hut worker registrations, ensuring that only authorized personnel can update hut-related data. Managers can also broadcast weather alerts for specific areas, notifying all hikers in those regions through push notifications. This ensures that users stay informed about potentially hazardous conditions.\\\n",
    "The platform manager's role includes maintaining an organized and secure user system while facilitating collaboration between local guides, hut workers, and visitors.\\\n",
    "Hut workers are critical to the maintenance of up-to-date trail and accommodation information. After registering and being verified, hut workers can log into the platform to add or update information about their assigned huts, including uploading pictures and describing the facilities available. They can also monitor and report on the condition of nearby trails, ensuring hikers receive current information.\\\n",
    "Hut workers play a vital role in providing situational updates for hikers. For instance, if a nearby trail is impacted by severe weather or physical obstructions, they can communicate these conditions through the platform. This enhances the safety and preparedness of all hikers relying on the platform.\"\n",

      "    The proposed platform is designed to enhance the hiking experience for various user groups, including visitors, local guides, platform managers, and hut workers. The platform provides a centralized repository of hiking routes, hut information, and parking facilities. It also enables interactive features such as real-time hike tracking, personalized recommendations, and group hike planning. By combining these capabilities, the platform seeks to foster safe, informed, and collaborative hiking experiences.The platform will be deployed as a cloud-based web and mobile application accessible to all stakeholders. The distribution strategy includes an app available on major mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, alongside a responsive web interface. It will require an internet connection for features like real-time tracking, notifications, and user authentication, though some offline capabilities, such as pre-downloaded hike information, will also be available.User authentication will be role-based, ensuring that only authorized users, such as verified hut workers and platform managers, can access sensitive or administrative features.Visitors are the primary users of the platform. They can browse a comprehensive list of hiking trails, filter them based on specific criteria such as difficulty, length, or starting point, and view detailed descriptions. To access advanced features like personalized recommendations, visitors can create user accounts by registering on the platform. Registered users can record their fitness parameters, enabling the system to suggest trails tailored to their capabilities.During a hike, visitors can record their progress by marking reference points and sharing their live location through a broadcasting URL. They can also initiate group activities by planning hikes, adding group members, and confirming group participation. The platform allows visitors to start, terminate, and track their hikes, with notifications for unfinished hikes or late group members to ensure safety and accountability.Local guides enrich the platform by contributing essential information. They can add detailed descriptions of hikes, parking facilities, and huts, ensuring hikers have accurate and comprehensive data. Local guides also link parking lots and huts to specific trails as starting or arrival points, enhancing the planning process.To aid in the visual representation and accessibility of information, local guides can upload pictures of huts and connect these locations directly to hikes. This integration simplifies route planning and helps visitors visualize their journey.Platform managers oversee the operational integrity and safety of the platform. They verify new hut worker registrations, ensuring that only authorized personnel can update hut-related data. Managers can also broadcast weather alerts for specific areas, notifying all hikers in those regions through push notifications. This ensures that users stay informed about potentially hazardous conditions.The platform manager's role includes maintaining an organized and secure user system while facilitating collaboration between local guides, hut workers, and visitors.Hut workers are critical to the maintenance of up-to-date trail and accommodation information. After registering and being verified, hut workers can log into the platform to add or update information about their assigned huts, including uploading pictures and describing the facilities available. They can also monitor and report on the condition of nearby trails, ensuring hikers receive current information.Hut workers play a vital role in providing situational updates for hikers. For instance, if a nearby trail is impacted by severe weather or physical obstructions, they can communicate these conditions through the platform. This enhances the safety and preparedness of all hikers relying on the platform.\n",

    "In this step, the focus is on extracting the purposes behind the functions identified in the previous step. The purpose refers to the underlying reasons or motivations that drive a role to perform a particular function within the system. The language model (LLM) is prompted to identify these reasons by analyzing the problem description and the functions extracted in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the functions (what the roles want to do) are identified, the LLM is tasked with understanding and extracting the why behind each function. For example, a role like \"hiker\" may want to \"register for a hike\" (function), but the purpose behind this action might be \"so that they can track their progress\" or \"to ensure they can participate in the hike.\" Similarly, a \"local guide\" may want to \"add a hike description,\" and the purpose could be \"to provide helpful information to other users.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The extracted purposes help provide a deeper understanding of why each function is important to the roles. These purposes are essential for refining the system’s objectives and ensuring that the design aligns with the actual needs and motivations of the stakeholders. The LLM identifies these purposes by analyzing both the context of the roles and the corresponding functions, ensuring that all relevant purposes are captured to provide clarity for the user stories that will follow in the next step."
